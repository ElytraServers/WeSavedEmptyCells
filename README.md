# WeSavedEmptyCells

## DEPRECATED

The feature that provided in this mode has been moved to [GTNH-No-Nerf](https://github.com/Taskeren/gtnh-no-nerf).

## What's This?

There is a thing that when you place the fluid (like Water) to the world from the Cells, the cells are consumed.
But they are not consumed when using in the GUIs like machines.

**So this mod modified the behavior that the cells will no longer be consumed when placing fluids into the world.**
